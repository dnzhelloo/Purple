# Rick and Morty App

This is a simple iOS application to view characters and episodes from the Rick and Morty Graphql API. The app is built using SwiftUI.

## Motivation

The motivation behind the Rick and Morty App is to develop a clean, minimal, and highly-readable iOS application that showcases my skills as an iOS developer. The main objectives of this project are:

- **Minimalism and Readability:** The app will have a simple and intuitive user interface, allowing users to easily explore characters and episodes from the beloved Rick and Morty animated series.

- **Modular Architecture:** The project is structured with a modular approach to promote maintainability and scalability. Each module will have a clear purpose, making it easier to expand and enhance the app in the future.

- **SwiftUI Proficiency:** By building the app with SwiftUI, I aim to deepen my knowledge and proficiency in this modern framework and embrace the declarative programming paradigm.

- **Adherence to Apple Human Interface Guidelines:** The app will be developed in strict compliance with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience that aligns with iOS design standards.

- **Scalable Application:** With a focus on scalability, the app is designed to handle future growth and accommodate new features without sacrificing performance.

- **Performance Optimization:** Special attention is given to performance optimization to ensure the app delivers smooth and responsive interactions to users.
